Hey!  This isn't so much a standalone "here you go tethering" app as much as it is a couple of scripts to go along side the video at:

There's a video on youtube with the basics, although the actual scripts from that version are in the YOUTUBE-VERSION-OLD folder here.  The newer version is better.

Either script you use:

1) Put ktether and ktether-hook.sh somewhere, preferably in your path so you can run it from anywhere.
2) edit the top of the file to point at a placeholder_image on your system to be used as the initially viewed image when you run the script

If you use the most recent version you need to also install:

- geeqie (used as the preview image program as it works great with the NEF)
- speaker-test (used to "beep" if the camera gets disconnected

To use, 
- go to the directory where you want the camera files to end up
- type ktether (or /path/to/ktether if you haven't put it somewhere in your path)

Options,
If you start e.g. 
ktether fashion-shoot
then camera files will be renamed fashion-shoot-0001.NEF, fashion-shoot-0002.NEF etc
