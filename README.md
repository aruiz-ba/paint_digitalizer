# Rembrandt and Manuel: an artistic fusion with Stable Diffusion

By applying Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth to the digitized work, impressive results can be obtained that reinvent a Rembrandt portrait through the style of only landscape works by the artist Manuel Ruiz Ortega. This allows Stable Diffusion to be taught to paint like Manuel, but only understanding Manuel’s world through his landscape painting, completely ignoring his portraits and paintings with human or animal figures. This creates magnificent results where AI fuses natural landscapes from Manuel’s childhood with the clothing of the portrait and completes the face’s unknown with a midpoint between Rembrandt’s portraits and Manuel’s style, achieving an exquisite fusion of both styles.
